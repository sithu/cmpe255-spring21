# Lab 3 - Classification

[Pima Indian Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?select=diabetes.csv) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Question

* Can we predict the diabetes status of a patient given their health measurements? Build a classifer and calculate Confusion matrix with

- True Positives (TP): we correctly predicted that they do have diabetes
- True Negatives (TN): we correctly predicted that they don't have diabetes
- False Positives (FP): we incorrectly predicted that they do have diabetes (a "Type I error")
- False Negatives (FN): we incorrectly predicted that they don't have diabetes (a "Type II error")
